# eggplant
it's a lego robot that spanks you whenever you take damage in surviv.io(browser-based fortnite knockoff)

I did end up separating the motor from the brick which made it fall over less. Unfortunately don't have a video of the improved version because it was made for a school project with school-borrowed materials, so I had to return all the hardware :(

next steps: create a stronger arm design that is able to support the weight of an eggplant, so that the end user can be spanked with an eggplant.
